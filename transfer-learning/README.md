## Project: Transferred Learning (CovNet)

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.x or Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/install.html) (v0.17)
- [TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

```

### Code

A template notebook is provided as `Transfer_Learning.ipynb`. While the model code is included in the notebook, you will be required to download the trained model and untar it before executing the notebook.  

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `transfer_learning/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook digit_recognition.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook digit_recognition.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and notebook file in your browser.


### Data

You have to download the tar file from the google drive to get the pretrained model to work. Untar the files into folder checkpoints. Rest of the instruction are detailed in the notebook itself.[Pre-trained model for flower classification](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2eS2ZLFV-P1aExvWC1oeG5IOU0).
